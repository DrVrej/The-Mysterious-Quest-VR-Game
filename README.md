# The Mysterious Quest (VR Game)
Small VR game created on Unity using Microsoft Mixed Reality.

# Game Overview:
The Mysterious Quest is a VR game where the player has to solve puzzles to figure out a mystery. The game theme takes place in an isolated modern house, with open ceilings, with mountain views, containing four rooms where each room has a puzzle for the player to solve. Additionally, the house has an artifact room to hold the prizes (artifacts) obtained by solving each of the four puzzles. We have a mystery at the completion of all the puzzles that shall not be spoiled, and it is up to the player to figure it out. Each puzzle room has one of the four elements of nature (earth, water, air, and fire). The artifacts in each room are either shown or hidden. If it is shown you won't be able to retrieve it until the puzzle is solved, and if it is hidden you need to find a way to find it. Moreover, the game will have a light indicator displaying the status of the completion of each puzzle. Red means the puzzle is not solved and green means the puzzle is solved. Once the player retrieves an artifact they need to bring it to the artifact room and place it on its designated spot. Good luck!
